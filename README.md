# libft
# Project Overview
libft is a C language library that provides a collection of custom implementations of standard C library functions. The library is designed to be portable, efficient, and easy to use. <br>

The libft library includes implementations of several standard C library functions, as well as additional custom functions. Some of the standard C library functions that are included are: <br>

* memset: fills memory with a constant byte <br>
* memcpy: copies memory from one location to another <br>
* memcmp: compares two blocks of memory <br>
* strlen: computes the length of a string <br>
* strdup: duplicates a string <br>

In addition to the standard C library functions, the libft library includes several custom functions, such as: <br>

* ft_strjoin: concatenates two strings into a new string <br>
* ft_strtrim: trims whitespace from the beginning and end of a string <br>
* ft_lstnew: creates a new linked list node <br>
* ft_lstadd_front: adds a new node to the beginning of a linked list <br>
* ft_lstsize: counts the number of nodes in a linked list <br>
The libft library also includes additional data structures and utility functions that can be useful in C programming. <br>

Overall, the libft library is a useful tool for C programmers who want to extend the functionality of the standard C library with their own custom implementations. <br>
